# The Ruby Style Guide

Our style guide is a fork of
[bbatsov's great work](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
We mainly stripped out all rules [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
analyzes and punctually made changes.

You can generate a PDF or an HTML copy of this guide using
[Transmuter](https://github.com/TechnoGate/transmuter).

## Source Code Layout

> Nearly everybody is convinced that every style but their own is
> ugly and unreadable. Leave out the "but their own" and they're
> probably right... <br/>
> -- Jerry Coffin (on indentation)

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.

* Prefer a single-line format for class definitions with no body.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class FooError < StandardError
    end

    # bad
    class FooError < StandardError; end

    # good
    FooError = Class.new(StandardError)
    ```

* Use spaces  after  . Whitespace might be (mostly) irrelevant to the Ruby
  interpreter, but its proper use is the key to writing easily
  readable code.


    `{` and `}` deserve a bit of clarification, since they are used
    for block and hash literals, as well as embedded expressions in
    strings. For hash literals only the second of the following styles is
    considered acceptable.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - space after { and before }
    { one: 1, two: 2 }

    # good - no space after { and before }
    {one: 1, two: 2}
    ```

    As far as embedded expressions go, there is also only one acceptable
    option:

    ```Ruby
    # good - no spaces
    "string#{expr}"

    # bad
    "string#{ expr }"
    ```

    The first style is extremely more popular and you're generally
    advised to stick with it. The second, on the other hand, is
    (arguably) a bit more readable. As with hashes - pick one style
    and apply it consistently.

* When assigning the result of a conditional expression to a variable, preserve the usual alignment of its branches.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - pretty convoluted
    kind = case year
    when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
    when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
    when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
    when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
    when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
    else 'Jazz'
    end

    result = if some_cond
      calc_something
    else
      calc_something_else
    end

    # bad - it's apparent what's going on
    kind = case year
           when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
           when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
           when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
           when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
           when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
           else 'Jazz'
           end

    result = if some_cond
               calc_something
             else
               calc_something_else
             end

    # good (and a bit more width efficient)
    kind =
      case year
      when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
      when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
      when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
      when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
      when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
      else 'Jazz'
      end

    result =
      if some_cond
        calc_something
      else
        calc_something_else
      end
    ```

* Use empty lines between method definitions and also to break up a method into logical
  paragraphs internally.

    ```Ruby
    def some_method
      data = initialize(options)

      data.manipulate!

      data.result
    end

    def some_method
      result
    end
    ```

* Avoid line continuation `\` where not required. In practice, avoid using
  line continuations for anything but string concatenation.

    ```Ruby
    # ok
    result = 1 - \
             2

    # good (but still ugly as hell)
    result = 1 \
             - 2

    long_string = 'First part of the long string' \
                  ' and second part of the long string'
    ```


* Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one
  line. When aligning parameters is not appropriate due to line-length
  constraints, single indent for the lines after the first is also
  acceptable.

  TODO: Konfigurierbar?

    ```Ruby
    # bad: starting point (line is too long)
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com', from: 'us@example.com', subject: 'Important message', body: source.text)
    end

    # bad (double indent)
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(
          to: 'bob@example.com',
          from: 'us@example.com',
          subject: 'Important message',
          body: source.text)
    end

    # good
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com',
                     from: 'us@example.com',
                     subject: 'Important message',
                     body: source.text)
    end

    # good (normal indent)
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(
        to: 'bob@example.com',
        from: 'us@example.com',
        subject: 'Important message',
        body: source.text
      )
    end
    ```

* Align the elements of array literals spanning multiple lines.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - single indent
    menu_item = ["Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam",
      "Baked beans", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam"]

    # good
    menu_item = [
      "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam",
      "Baked beans", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam"
    ]

    # good
    menu_item =
      ["Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam",
       "Baked beans", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam", "Spam"]
    ```


## Syntax

* Never use `while/until condition do` for multi-line `while/until`.
  TODO: HÃ¤?
    ```Ruby
    # bad
    while x > 5 do
      # body omitted
    end

    until x > 5 do
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    while x > 5
      # body omitted
    end

    until x > 5
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks.  Avoid using
  `{...}` for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always
  ugly). Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs).

    ```Ruby
    names = ['Bozhidar', 'Steve', 'Sarah']

    # bad
    names.each do |name|
      puts name
    end

    # good
    names.each { |name| puts name }

    # good
    names.select do |name|
      name.start_with?('S')
    end.map { |name| name.upcase }

    # good
    names.select { |name| name.start_with?('S') }.map { |name| name.upcase }
    ```

    Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of {...}, but they should
    ask themselves - is this code really readable and can the blocks' contents be extracted into
    nifty methods?

* As a corollary, avoid shadowing methods with local variables unless they are both equivalent.

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      attr_accessor :options

      # ok
      def initialize(options)
        self.options = options
        # both options and self.options are equivalent here
      end

      # bad
      def do_something(options = {})
        unless options[:when] == :later
          output(self.options[:message])
        end
      end

      # good
      def do_something(params = {})
        unless params[:when] == :later
          output(options[:message])
        end
      end
    end
    ```

* Use `||=` freely to initialize variables.

    ```Ruby
    # set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
    name ||= 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables. (Consider what
would happen if the current value happened to be `false`.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?
    ```

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis,
  always use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write
`f((3 + 2) + 1)`.

* Prefer `proc.call()` over `proc[]` or `proc.()` for both lambdas and procs.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - looks similar to Enumeration access
    l = ->(v) { puts v }
    l[1]

    # also bad - uncommon syntax
    l = ->(v) { puts v }
    l.(1)

    # good
    l = ->(v) { puts v }
    l.call(1)
    ```


* Use `$stdout/$stderr/$stdin` instead of
  `STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN`. `STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN` are constants, and
  while you can actually reassign (possibly to redirect some stream)
  constants in Ruby, you'll get an interpreter warning if you do so.

* Use `warn` instead of `$stderr.puts`. Apart from being more concise
and clear, `warn` allows you to suppress warnings if you need to (by
setting the warn level to 0 via `-W0`).

* Use `[*var]` or `Array()` instead of explicit `Array` check, when dealing with a
  variable you want to treat as an Array, but you're not certain it's
  an array.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    paths = [paths] unless paths.is_a? Array
    paths.each { |path| do_something(path) }

    # good
    [*paths].each { |path| do_something(path) }

    # good (and a bit more readable)
    Array(paths).each { |path| do_something(path) }
    ```

* Use ranges or `Comparable#between?` instead of complex comparison logic when possible.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    do_something if x >= 1000 && x <= 2000

    # good
    do_something if (1000..2000).include?(x)

    # good
    do_something if x.between?(1000, 2000)
    ```

* Avoid the use of flip-flops.

## Naming

> The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
> naming things. <br/>
> -- Phil Karlton

* Name identifiers in English.

* Use `snake_case` for symbols.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    :'some symbol'
    :SomeSymbol
    :someSymbol

    # good
    :some_symbol
    ```

* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`).
* The names of potentially *dangerous* methods (i.e. methods that
  modify `self` or the arguments, `exit!` (doesn't run the finalizers
  like `exit` does), etc.) should end with an exclamation mark if
  there exists a safe version of that *dangerous* method.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - there is not matching 'safe' method
    class Person
      def update!
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update!
      end

      def update
      end
    end
    ```

* Define the non-bang (safe) method in terms of the bang (dangerous)
  one if possible.

    ```Ruby
    class Array
      def flatten_once!
        res = []

        each do |e|
          [*e].each { |f| res << f }
        end

        replace(res)
      end

      def flatten_once
        dup.flatten_once!
      end
    end
    ```

* Use `flat_map` instead of `map` + `flatten`.
  This does not apply for arrays with a depth greater than 2, i.e.
  if `users.first.songs == ['a', ['b','c']]`, then use `map + flatten` rather than `flat_map`.
  `flat_map` flattens the array by 1, whereas `flatten` flattens it all the way.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    all_songs = users.map(&:songs).flatten.uniq

    # good
    all_songs = users.flat_map(&:songs).uniq
    ```

* Use `reverse_each` instead of `reverse.each`. `reverse_each` doesn't
  do a new array allocation and that's a good thing.


    ```Ruby
    # bad
    array.reverse.each { ... }

    # good
    array.reverse_each { ... }
    ```

## Comments

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
> comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this
> comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make
> it even clearer. <br/>
> -- Steve McConnell

* Write self-documenting code.
* Write comments in German.
* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use [one
  space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.
* Avoid superfluous comments.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    counter += 1 # ErhÃ¶ht counter um eins.
    ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no comment
at all.

> Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation. <br/>
> -- Russ Olsen

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
  make it self-explanatory. (Do or do not - there is no try. --Yoda)

### Comment Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
  the relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
  lines should be indented like this:

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      # TODO: Seit Version 3.2.1 von BarBazUtil kracht es hier gewaltig.
      baz(:quux)
    end
    ```

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would
  be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line
  with no note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      sleep 100 # TODO: Optimieren
    end
    ```

* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
  added at a later date.
* Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices
  were used and should be refactored away.

## Classes & Modules

* Use a consistent structure in your class definitions.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      # extend and include go first
      extend SomeModule
      include AnotherModule

      # constants are next
      SOME_CONSTANT = 20

      # afterwards we have attribute macros
      attr_reader :name

      # followed by other macros (if any)
      validates :name

      # public class methods are next in line
      def self.some_method
      end

      # followed by public instance methods
      def some_method
      end

      # protected and private methods are grouped near the end
      protected

      def some_protected_method
      end

      private

      def some_private_method
      end
    end
    ```

* Prefer modules to classes with only class methods. Classes should be
  used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class SomeClass
      def self.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def self.some_other_method
      end
    end

    # good
    module SomeClass
      module_function

      def some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def some_other_method
      end
    end
    ```

* Consider using `Struct.new`, which defines the trivial accessors,
constructor and comparison operators for you.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end
    end

    # better
    Person = Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name) do
    end
    ````

* Prefer [duck-typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) over inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Animal
      # abstract method
      def speak
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Duck < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Dog < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end

    # good
    class Duck
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    class Dog
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end
    ```

* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). After all we're coding
in *Ruby* now, not in *Python*.

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the code
  easier to refactor since the class name is not repeated.
  Avoid `class << self` except when necessary, e.g. single accessors and aliased
  attributes.

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass

      # Avoid the following style
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end

      # Necessary
      class << self
        attr_accessor :per_page
        alias_method :items_per_page, :per_page
      end
    end
    ```

## Exceptions


* Mitigate the proliferation of `begin` blocks by using
  *contingency methods* (a term coined by Avdi Grimm).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      something_that_might_fail
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    begin
      something_else_that_might_fail
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    # good
    def with_io_error_handling
       yield
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    with_io_error_handling { something_that_might_fail }

    with_io_error_handling { something_else_that_might_fail }
    ```

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    else
      n / d
    end
    ```

* Put more specific exceptions higher up the rescue chain, otherwise
  they'll never be rescued from.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # some code
    rescue Exception => e
      # some handling
    rescue StandardError => e
      # some handling
    end

    # good
    begin
      # some code
    rescue StandardError => e
      # some handling
    rescue Exception => e
      # some handling
    end
    ```

* Release external resources obtained by your program in an ensure
block.

    ```Ruby
    f = File.open('testfile')
    begin
      # .. process
    rescue
      # .. handle error
    ensure
      f.close unless f.nil?
    end
    ```

* Favor the use of exceptions for the standard library over
introducing new exception classes.

## Collections

* Prefer `%i` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
symbols(and you don't need to maintain Ruby 1.9 compatibility). Apply
this rule only to arrays with two or more elements.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    STATES = [:draft, :open, :closed]

    # good
    STATES = %i(draft open closed)
    ```

* Avoid the creation of huge gaps in arrays.

    ```Ruby
    arr = []
    arr[100] = 1 # now you have an array with lots of nils
    ```

* When accessing the first or last element from an array, prefer `first` or `last` over `[0]` or `[-1]`.

* Prefer symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Avoid the use of mutable objects as hash keys.

* Introduce boolean default values for hash keys via `Hash#fetch` as opposed to
  using custom logic.

   ```Ruby
   batman = { name: 'Bruce Wayne', is_evil: false }

   # bad - if we just use || operator with falsy value we won't get the expected result
   batman[:is_evil] || true # => true

   # good - fetch work correctly with falsy values
   batman.fetch(:is_evil, true) # => false
   ```

* Rely on the fact that as of Ruby 1.9 hashes are ordered.
* Never modify a collection while traversing it.

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
    ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
    ```

* When using heredocs for multi-line strings keep in mind the fact
  that they preserve leading whitespace. It's a good practice to
  employ some margin based on which to trim the excessive whitespace.

    ```Ruby
    code = <<-END.gsub(/^\s+\|/, '')
      |def test
      |  some_method
      |  other_method

## Regular Expressions

> "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.<br/>
> -- Jamie Zawinski

* Don't use regular expressions if you just need plain text search in string:
  `string['text']`

* Avoid using numbered groups as it can be hard to track what they contain. Named groups
  can be used instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    /(regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process Regexp.last_match[1]

    # good
    /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process meaningful_var
    ```

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string endings.
  If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\z` (not to be
  confused with `\Z` which is the equivalent of `/\n?\z/`).

    ```Ruby
    string = "some injection\nusername"
    string[/^username$/]   # matches
    string[/\Ausername\z/] # don't match
    ```

* Use `x` modifier for complex regexps. This makes them more readable and you
  can add some useful comments. Just be careful as spaces are ignored.

    ```Ruby
    regexp = %r{
      start         # some text
      \s            # white space char
      (group)       # first group
      (?:alt1|alt2) # some alternation
      end
    }x
    ```

## Percent Literals

* Use `%()`(it's a shorthand for `%Q`) for single-line strings which require both interpolation
  and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs.

    ```Ruby
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)
    ```

## Metaprogramming

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
  (Do not monkey-patch them.)

* Avoid using `method_missing` for metaprogramming because backtraces become messy, the behavior is not listed in `#methods`, and misspelled method calls might silently work, e.g. `nukes.launch_state = false`. Consider using delegation, proxy, or `define_method` instead. If you must use `method_missing`:

  - Be sure to [also define `respond_to_missing?`](http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2010/11/methodmissing-politely.html)
  - Only catch methods with a well-defined prefix, such as `find_by_*` -- make your code as assertive as possible.
  - Call `super` at the end of your statement
  - Delegate to assertive, non-magical methods:

    ```ruby
    # bad
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        # ... lots of code to do a find_by
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # good
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        find_by(prop, *args, &block)
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # best of all, though, would to define_method as each findable attribute is declared
    ```

## Misc

* Prefer `Time.now` over `Time.new` when retrieving the current system time.
* Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.

## Ruby on Rails

* When [converting](http://www.elabs.se/blog/36-working-with-time-zones-in-ruby-on-rails) `Date` to `Time` always use `#to_time_with_zone`.
* Always set `config.time_zone` in `application.rb`.
