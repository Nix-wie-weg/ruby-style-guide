# The Ruby Style Guide

Our style guide is a fork of
[bbatsov's great work](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
We mainly stripped out all rules [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
analyzes and punctually made changes.

You can generate a PDF or an HTML copy of this guide using
[Transmuter](https://github.com/TechnoGate/transmuter).

## Source Code Layout

> Nearly everybody is convinced that every style but their own is
> ugly and unreadable. Leave out the "but their own" and they're
> probably right... <br/>
> -- Jerry Coffin (on indentation)

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.


## Syntax

* As a corollary, avoid shadowing methods with local variables unless they are both equivalent.

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      attr_accessor :options

      # ok
      def initialize(options)
        self.options = options
        # both options and self.options are equivalent here
      end

      # bad
      def do_something(options = {})
        unless options[:when] == :later
          output(self.options[:message])
        end
      end

      # good
      def do_something(params = {})
        unless params[:when] == :later
          output(options[:message])
        end
      end
    end
    ```

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables. (Consider what
would happen if the current value happened to be `false`.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?
    ```

* Use `[*var]` or `Array()` instead of explicit `Array` check, when dealing with a
  variable you want to treat as an Array, but you're not certain it's
  an array.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    paths = [paths] unless paths.is_a? Array
    paths.each { |path| do_something(path) }

    # good
    [*paths].each { |path| do_something(path) }

    # good (and a bit more readable)
    Array(paths).each { |path| do_something(path) }
    ```

* Use ranges or `Comparable#between?` instead of complex comparison logic when possible.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    do_something if x >= 1000 && x <= 2000

    # good
    do_something if (1000..2000).include?(x)

    # good
    do_something if x.between?(1000, 2000)
    ```

## Naming

> The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
> naming things. <br/>
> -- Phil Karlton

* Use `snake_case` for symbols.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    :'some symbol'
    :SomeSymbol
    :someSymbol

    # good
    :some_symbol
    ```

* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`).
* The names of potentially *dangerous* methods (i.e. methods that
  modify `self` or the arguments, `exit!` (doesn't run the finalizers
  like `exit` does), etc.) should end with an exclamation mark if
  there exists a safe version of that *dangerous* method.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - there is not matching 'safe' method
    class Person
      def update!
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update!
      end

      def update
      end
    end
    ```

* Define the non-bang (safe) method in terms of the bang (dangerous)
  one if possible.

    ```Ruby
    class Array
      def flatten_once!
        res = []

        each do |e|
          [*e].each { |f| res << f }
        end

        replace(res)
      end

      def flatten_once
        dup.flatten_once!
      end
    end
    ```

## Classes & Modules

* Prefer modules to classes with only class methods. Classes should be
  used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class SomeClass
      def self.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def self.some_other_method
      end
    end

    # good
    module SomeClass
      module_function

      def some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def some_other_method
      end
    end
    ```

* Consider using `Struct.new`, which defines the trivial accessors,
constructor and comparison operators for you.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end
    end

    # better
    Person = Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name) do
    end
    ````

* Prefer [duck-typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) over inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Animal
      # abstract method
      def speak
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Duck < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Dog < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end

    # good
    class Duck
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    class Dog
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end
    ```

* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). After all we're coding
in *Ruby* now, not in *Python*.

## Exceptions

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    else
      n / d
    end
    ```

* Release external resources obtained by your program in an ensure
block.

    ```Ruby
    f = File.open('testfile')
    begin
      # .. process
    rescue
      # .. handle error
    ensure
      f.close unless f.nil?
    end
    ```

* Favor the use of exceptions for the standard library over
introducing new exception classes.

## Collections

* Prefer symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Avoid the use of mutable objects as hash keys.
* Rely on the fact that as of Ruby 1.9 hashes are ordered.
* Never modify a collection while traversing it.

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
    ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
    ```

* When using heredocs for multi-line strings keep in mind the fact
  that they preserve leading whitespace. It's a good practice to
  employ some margin based on which to trim the excessive whitespace.

    ```Ruby
    code = <<-END.gsub(/^\s+\|/, '')
      |def test
      |  some_method
      |  other_method
      |end
    END
    #=> "def\n  some_method\n  \nother_method\nend"
    ```

## Regular Expressions

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think
> "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.<br/>
> -- Jamie Zawinski

* Don't use regular expressions if you just need plain text search in string:
  `string['text']`

* Avoid using numbered groups as it can be hard to track what they contain. Named groups
  can be used instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    /(regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process Regexp.last_match[1]

    # good
    /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process meaningful_var
    ```

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string endings.
  If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\z` (not to be
  confused with `\Z` which is the equivalent of `/\n?\z/`).

    ```Ruby
    string = "some injection\nusername"
    string[/^username$/]   # matches
    string[/\Ausername\z/] # don't match
    ```

* Use `x` modifier for complex regexps. This makes them more readable and you
  can add some useful comments. Just be careful as spaces are ignored.

    ```Ruby
    regexp = %r{
      start         # some text
      \s            # white space char
      (group)       # first group
      (?:alt1|alt2) # some alternation
      end
    }x
    ```

## Percent Literals

* Use `%()`(it's a shorthand for `%Q`) for single-line strings which require both interpolation
  and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs.

    ```Ruby
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)
    ```

## Metaprogramming

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
  (Do not monkey-patch them.)

* Avoid using `method_missing` for metaprogramming because backtraces become messy, the behavior is not listed in `#methods`, and misspelled method calls might silently work, e.g. `nukes.launch_state = false`. Consider using delegation, proxy, or `define_method` instead. If you must use `method_missing`:

  - Be sure to [also define `respond_to_missing?`](http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2010/11/methodmissing-politely.html)
  - Only catch methods with a well-defined prefix, such as `find_by_*` -- make your code as assertive as possible.
  - Call `super` at the end of your statement
  - Delegate to assertive, non-magical methods:

    ```ruby
    # bad
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        # ... lots of code to do a find_by
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # good
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        find_by(prop, *args, &block)
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # best of all, though, would to define_method as each findable attribute is declared
    ```

## Misc

* Prefer `Time.now` over `Time.new` when retrieving the current system time.
* Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.

## Ruby on Rails

* Prefer `Time.zone.now` and `Time.current` over `Time.now` when retrieving the current system time.
* Prefer `Date.zone.today` and `Date.current` over `Date.today` when retrieving todays date.
* When [converting](http://www.elabs.se/blog/36-working-with-time-zones-in-ruby-on-rails) `Date` to `Time` always use `#to_time_with_zone`.
* Always set `config.time_zone` in `application.rb`.
